# Hi!

I am PhD student in [Shanghai Center for Mathematics Science](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/) at Fudan university, Shanghai, China. My supervisor is Hehui Wu. My bachelor degree was also completed at Fudan uniiversity. 

Currently I am enjoying my visit at [MC2 team](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/MC2/) in [LIP](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP) at ENS Lyon, Lyon, France, supported by Chinese Scholarship COuncil. My supervisor in ENS is [Stéphan Thomassé](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/stephan.thomasse/).

# (Proceeding) Research Projects

TBC

1. **Chromatic number of Light tournament**  
   Lucas Isenmann, Clara Marcille, Alantha Newman, Chaoliang Tang

# Hobbies

Cycling: I used to be a member of Fudan University Cycling Team.

Hiking: Take me into mountains plz. I will be in Mont Blanc in the summer of 2025.

Boardgames: I can play the whole night.

Anything esle that is dangerous.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
